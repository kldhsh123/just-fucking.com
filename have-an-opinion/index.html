<h1>Just Fucking Have an Opinion</h1>

<section>
  <h2>The Opening Punch</h2>

  <p>
    "Well, it's complicated." "Both sides have valid points." "I try to
    stay objective." "It really depends on the context."
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Shut the fuck up.</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    You're not being thoughtful. You're not being balanced. You're not
    being wise. You're being a coward who's too scared to say what you
    actually think because someone might disagree with you.
  </p>

  <p>
    Your fake neutrality isn't enlightenment. It's cowardice with a
    thesaurus.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>The Lie You Tell Yourself</h2>

  <p>
    "I'm just being objective."
  </p>

  <p>
    No, you're not. You're avoiding the discomfort of having a position.
    True objectivity means looking at the evidence and reaching a
    conclusion. You're skipping the conclusion part because conclusions
    are scary.
  </p>

  <p>
    "But every issue has nuance!"
  </p>

  <p>
    Yes, and after considering the nuance, you should still be able to
    say which side you lean toward. "It's nuanced" is not a position.
    It's an observation that everyone already knows. Congratulations,
    you've contributed nothing.
  </p>

  <p>
    Real thinkers don't hide behind complexity. They wade through it
    and come out the other side with an actual stance. You're just
    standing at the edge, pretending the water is too deep.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>The Reality Check</h2>

  <p>
    Here's what your fake neutrality actually accomplishes:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      You waste everyone's time in meetings because you won't commit to
      a direction
    </li>
    <li>
      Decisions get delayed while people wait for you to actually say
      something useful
    </li>
    <li>
      You become the person nobody asks for input because your input is
      always "it depends"
    </li>
    <li>
      You silently enable bad decisions because you were too polite to
      object
    </li>
    <li>
      People stop respecting you because they realize you stand for
      nothing
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The world doesn't need more people who can see both sides. It needs
    people who can see both sides and then pick one.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>The Example That Hurts</h2>

  <p>
    The team is deciding between two technical approaches. Person A
    argues for microservices. Person B argues for a monolith. Everyone
    looks to you.
  </p>

  <p>
    What you say: "Well, both approaches have merit. Microservices offer
    scalability but add complexity. Monoliths are simpler but might not
    scale as well. It really depends on your specific needs."
  </p>

  <p>
    What you contributed: Absolutely fucking nothing. Everyone already
    knew that. You just repeated the question back in different words.
  </p>

  <p>
    What you should have said: "Given our team size and current stage,
    I think we should start with a monolith. Here's why..."
  </p>

  <p>
    That's an opinion. It might be wrong. But at least it moves the
    conversation forward instead of leaving everyone exactly where they
    started.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>The Future You're Creating</h2>

  <p>
    Fence-sitters don't lead. They don't innovate. They don't change
    anything. They just occupy space while real decisions get made by
    people willing to be wrong.
  </p>

  <p>
    Every great achievement in history came from someone who said "I
    believe this" and acted on it. Not from someone who said "Well,
    there are valid arguments on both sides, so let's form a committee."
  </p>

  <p>
    You want to be taken seriously? Have the courage to be wrong. Have
    the spine to disagree. Have a fucking opinion.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>The Closing Hammer</h2>

  <p>
    Next time someone asks what you think:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Don't say "it depends" unless you immediately follow with what
    it depends on and which way you lean</li>
    <li>Don't say "both sides have a point" unless you also say which
    point is stronger</li>
    <li>Don't hide behind "I need more information" if you actually have
    enough to form a preliminary view</li>
    <li>Don't mistake not offending anyone with being helpful</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    You can acknowledge complexity while still having a position. You
    can be humble about being wrong while still stating what you believe.
    These things are not mutually exclusive.
  </p>
