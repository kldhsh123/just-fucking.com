<h1>Just Fucking Read the Error Message</h1>

<section>
  <h2>The Opening Punch</h2>

  <p>
    You saw red text. Your brain shut off. You ran to Stack Overflow,
    Discord, your coworker, ChatGPT, anyone but yourself.
  </p>

  <p>
    And the entire time, the answer was sitting right there.
    <strong>In the error message you didn't read.</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    The computer literally told you what went wrong. Line number included.
    File path included. Sometimes even a fucking suggestion on how to fix it.
    And you ignored all of it to ask "why isn't this working?"
  </p>

  <p>
    That's not debugging. That's refusing to participate in your own profession.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>The Lie You Tell Yourself</h2>

  <p>
    "Error messages are cryptic and unhelpful."
  </p>

  <p>
    No. <strong>You</strong> are cryptic and unhelpful. The error message
    is doing its job. It's telling you exactly what happened. You're the
    one who glazed over after seeing "Error" and decided reading was too
    much work.
  </p>

  <p>
    Modern error messages are not the segfaults of the 1970s. They come
    with:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>The exact file and line number</li>
    <li>The variable or function that failed</li>
    <li>The expected type vs. the actual type</li>
    <li>A stack trace showing how you got there</li>
    <li>Sometimes a link to the documentation</li>
    <li>Sometimes a literal "Did you mean X?" suggestion</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    And you still asked "what does this error mean?"
  </p>

  <p>
    The error message is not the problem. Your attention span is.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>The Reality Check</h2>

  <p>
    Here's what happens when you don't read the error:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      You waste your own time searching for answers that were already given to you
    </li>
    <li>
      You waste someone else's time when they ask "what's the error?" and you
      say "I don't know, something about null"
    </li>
    <li>
      You look incompetent when the answer was <code>Cannot read property 'x' of undefined at line 47</code>
      and you spent an hour looking at line 200
    </li>
    <li>
      You develop a learned helplessness where every error feels impossible
      because you never actually tried to understand one
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Senior developers aren't better at debugging because they're smarter.
    They're better because they actually read the damn error message
    before doing anything else.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>The Example That Hurts</h2>

  <p>
    The error says:
  </p>

  <pre><code>TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'map')
    at UserList (UserList.jsx:15:23)
    at renderWithHooks (react-dom.development.js:14985:18)</code></pre>

  <p>
    What you did: Googled "React map undefined error" and spent 30 minutes
    reading about optional chaining, default props, and state management
    patterns.
  </p>

  <p>
    What you should have done: Gone to <code>UserList.jsx</code>, line 15,
    column 23, and looked at what you were calling <code>.map()</code> on.
    Then traced back to where that variable came from. Total time: 2 minutes.
  </p>

  <p>
    The error gave you the address. You chose to wander the neighborhood
    asking strangers for directions instead.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>The Future You're Creating</h2>

  <p>
    Every time you skip reading the error, you reinforce the habit. You
    train yourself to panic instead of analyze. You become the developer
    who can't function without hand-holding.
  </p>

  <p>
    And when you're on-call at 3 AM and production is down, there won't
    be a Stack Overflow thread for your specific combination of problems.
    There won't be a coworker awake to ask. There will just be you and
    the error message.
  </p>

  <p>
    Will you read it then? Or will you freeze because you never learned how?
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>The Closing Hammer</h2>

  <p>
    Error messages exist to help you. They are the most honest feedback
    you will ever receive. They don't care about your feelings. They
    don't sugarcoat. They tell you exactly what went wrong.
  </p>

  <p>
    All you have to do is read them.
  </p>

  <p>
    So next time you see red text, stop. Read every word. Read the file
    path. Read the line number. Read the stack trace. Google the specific
    error text if you must, but only after you've actually read it.
  </p>
