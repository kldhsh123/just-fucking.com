  <h1>Just Fucking Say What You Want</h1>

  <p>
    "Hi"
  </p>

  <p>
    And then what? WHAT DO YOU WANT?
  </p>

  <p>
    You just sent me "hi" and now you're sitting there, watching the typing
    indicator, waiting for me to respond before you grace me with the actual
    reason you messaged me. Congratulations, you've invented the world's most
    pointless communication protocol. A two-step handshake that accomplishes
    absolutely nothing except wasting both our time and making me want to throw
    my phone into the ocean.

  <h2>The Anatomy of a Time Heist</h2>

  <p>
    Here's what happens when you send "hi" or "hey" or "are you there?" without
    any context:
  </p>

  <div class="chat">
    <div class="msg"><strong>You:</strong> Hi <span class="time">10:03 AM</span></div>
    <div class="msg"><strong>Me:</strong> (sees notification, stops working, switches context)</div>
    <div class="msg"><strong>Me:</strong> Hey, what's up? <span class="time">10:07 AM</span></div>
    <div class="msg"><strong>You:</strong> (typing...)</div>
    <div class="msg"><strong>You:</strong> Can you send me the Q3 report? <span class="time">10:09 AM</span></div>
  </div>

  <p>
    Six fucking minutes. Six minutes of my life stolen by your inability to type
    one complete sentence. I switched out of my work. I wondered what emergency
    you had. I worried if something was wrong. And all you wanted was a file you
    could have requested in your first message.
  </p>

  <p>
    You know what asynchronous communication means? It means we don't have to be
    online at the same time. It means I can read your message when I'm free and
    respond with the information you need. But YOU turned it into synchronous
    communication. You forced me to be present, to wait, to engage in a
    real-time dance just so you could ask a simple question. That's not
    communication. That's hostage-taking with extra steps.
  </p>

  <h2>Your "Politeness" Is Not Polite</h2>

  <p>
    "But I'm just being friendly!" No, you're not. You're being a coward. You're
    hiding behind fake social norms because you're too scared to state what you
    want directly. You think leading with "hi" is polite? It's the opposite.
    It's demanding someone's attention without telling them why they should give
    it to you.
  </p>

  <p>
    Real politeness is respecting people's time. Real politeness is giving them
    the information they need to make a decision. Real politeness is: "Hi! When
    you have a moment, could you send me the Q3 report? No rush." Done. Complete.
    I can read that, not respond for two hours while I'm in meetings, and then
    send you the file. Nobody's time is wasted. Nobody's waiting. Nobody's
    anxious.
  </p>

  <p>
    Your "hi" with no follow-up? That's not friendly. That's a demand dressed up
    in a smiley face. It says: "Stop what you're doing and pay attention to me
    right now, and I won't even tell you why." That's not politeness. That's
    entitlement with a thin veneer of manners.
  </p>

  <h2>The Waiting Game Nobody Wants to Play</h2>

  <p>
    Picture the person on the receiving end. They're in the middle of something.
    Code. Writing. Thinking. Then: *ping*. They see "Hi" from you. Now what?
    They have no idea if this is urgent or trivial. They don't know if you're
    about to ask for five minutes or five hours. They can't prioritize. They
    can't plan. They just have to... wait. For you. To finish typing. What you
    could have said in one message.
  </p>

  <p>
    And the worst part? You KNOW they've seen it. You can see the read receipt.
    So now there's pressure. They feel rude if they don't respond. You feel
    ignored if they don't respond fast enough. Everyone's stressed. Everyone's
    waiting. And for WHAT? So you could type "hi" first? What is this,
    kindergarten roll call?
  </p>

  <p>
    Every "hi" without context is a tiny act of disrespect. It says: "My
    inability to compose a complete thought is more important than your focus,
    your time, and your mental state." You're not being considerate. You're
    being lazy and dressing it up as etiquette.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>You Do This Too</h2>

  <p>
    And you know what's funny? You hate it when people do this to you. When your
    boss sends "Got a minute?" and nothing else, your stomach drops. When your
    partner texts "We need to talk" with no context, you spiral for hours. When
    your parent calls and says "Call me back" without saying why, you assume
    someone died.
  </p>

  <p>
    Context-free messages trigger anxiety. They force the recipient to fill in
    the blanks with worst-case scenarios. They create stress out of nothing.
    And YOU keep doing this to other people. Every day. Multiple times a day.
    Because typing an extra sentence is apparently too much work for your
    precious fingers.
  </p>

  <p>
    The "hi" message is a power move that pretends to be humility. It forces the
    other person to respond first, to commit their attention, before you reveal
    what you actually want. It's conversational entrapment. You're testing if
    they're available before you make your ask, so you can avoid the "rejection"
    of an unanswered message. That's not kindness. That's cowardice with
    delivery tracking.
  </p>

  <h2>You're an Adult. Communicate Like One.</h2>

  <p>
    This isn't complicated. When you message someone, include:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>What you want</li>
    <li>Why you need it (if relevant)</li>
    <li>How urgent it is</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    That's it. Three things. Often you only need one. "Can you review my PR when
    you're free?" Done. "The server's down, need help ASAP." Done. "Just wanted
    to say great job on the presentation." Done. Complete thoughts. Actionable
    messages. Respect for someone else's time and attention.
  </p>

  <p>
    But no. You'll send "hey" and wait. You'll send "quick question" and not ask
    it. You'll send "are you busy?" instead of just asking and letting them
    respond when they're not. Because deep down, you don't actually care about
    being polite. You care about being comfortable. And your comfort is not
    worth everyone else's interrupted workflow.
  </p>

  <p>
    Your "hi" is not friendly.<br>
    Your "are you there?" is not polite.<br>
    Your incomplete messages are not considerate.<br>
    They're lazy. They're selfish. They're disrespectful.<br>
    And everyone you message is tired of it.
