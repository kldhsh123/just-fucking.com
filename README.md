# just-fucking.com

Strong opinions for weak excuses.

This is not a blog. Not a tutorial. Not a discussion forum.
This is a collection of **uncompromising opinions** about bad habits in engineering and life.

## What This Is

Each page on this site is a manifesto. One opinion. No balance. No nuance. No "it depends."

The goal:
1. Make the reader uncomfortable
2. Make them realize you're right
3. Leave them with nothing to argue

---

## Structure

```
/
├── index.html              # Homepage
├── [topic]/
│   ├── index.html          # English version (primary)
│   └── [lang-code]/
│       └── index.html      # Translated version
└── ...
```

- English is the primary language
- Translations go in `/[topic]/[lang-code]/` (e.g., `/write-comments/ja/`, `/write-comments/zh/`)

---

## What We Accept

- **New manifestos** attacking specific bad habits
- **Translations** of existing pages
- **Improvements** to existing rants (make them sharper, not softer)

## What We Reject

- Balanced takes
- "Well, actually..." additions
- Best practices or tutorials
- Softening of language
- Nuance

This is not a place for reasonable discourse. This is a place for opinions that hurt.

## PR Requirements

### Before You Write

1. **One opinion per page.** Not two. Not three. One.
2. **Pick a behavior to attack.** Not a person. Not a company. Not a group. A behavior.
3. **Be prepared to be wrong.** You won't be, but be prepared.

### Content Rules

| Do | Don't |
|---|---|
| Attack behaviors and habits | Attack individuals or groups |
| Use profanity freely | Be gratuitously offensive without a point |
| Be direct and harsh | Be "edgy" for the sake of it |
| Make the reader feel called out | Preach to an imaginary idiot |
| End with a command | End with a suggestion |

### Structure (Follow This Order)

1. **Opening punch** — Call out the bullshit immediately
2. **Expose the lie** — Why the common excuse is wrong
3. **Reality check** — What actually happens because of this behavior
4. **Concrete example** — Show, don't just tell
5. **Future perspective** — Make them imagine the consequences
6. **Closing hammer** — Restate the opinion, harder

### Style Guide

- **Language:** Direct. Rude. Sarcastic. Unforgiving.
- **Swearing:** Allowed. Encouraged. But not every other word.
- **Length:** Long-form manifesto. This isn't Twitter.
- **Ending:** Must be a short, brutal, non-negotiable command.

### HTML Template

Use the existing pages as templates. Key points:

- Include proper meta tags (og:, twitter:, etc.)
- Use CSS variables for theming (dark/light mode)
- Keep the design minimal — this is a poster, not a magazine
- Include language switcher in nav

### File Naming

```
/your-topic/index.html            # English
/your-topic/[lang-code]/index.html  # Translation (e.g., ja, zh, es, de)
```

URL should be lowercase, hyphenated, imperative:
- ✅ `write-comments`
- ✅ `say-what-you-want`
- ❌ `writing-comments`
- ❌ `you-should-write-comments`

## PR Checklist

Before submitting:

- [ ] One opinion only

- [ ] Meta tags included
- [ ] Tested in both dark and light mode

## Translations

When translating:

1. **Don't translate literally.** Adapt to the language and culture.
2. **Match or exceed the intensity.** If the original says "damn," you can say worse in your language.
3. **Keep the structure identical.** Same sections, same order.
4. **Localize the examples.** If an example doesn't land in that culture, change it.
5. **Sound native.** It should feel like someone is yelling at a local developer, in their language.
6. **Attack behaviors, not people.** Profanity is fine. Personal attacks are not.

---

## What Happens to Your PR

1. We read it
2. If it makes us uncomfortable, that's good
3. If it makes us think "damn, they're right," it's in
4. If it tries to be balanced, it's out
5. If it attacks people instead of behaviors, it's out

No lengthy discussions. No design-by-committee. Either it fits or it doesn't.

## License

Public domain. Copy it, share it, put it on a billboard. We don't care.

The opinions are free. The consequences of ignoring them are not.
