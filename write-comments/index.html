  <h1>Just Fucking Write Comments</h1>

  <p>
    "My code is self-documenting."
  </p>

  <p>
    No it fucking isn't. Sit down.
  </p>

  <p>
    I've seen your code. Everyone's seen your code. It reads like a ransom note
    written by someone having a stroke. Your variable names aren't "expressive."
    Your function signatures aren't "intention-revealing." Your abstraction
    layers aren't "telling a story." They're hieroglyphics. Ancient, cryptic,
    indecipherable hieroglyphics that even you won't understand in six months.
    But sure, keep telling yourself it's self-documenting. Keep whispering that
    sweet little lie as you push another uncommented pile of garbage to main.

  <h2>The "Clean Code" Delusion</h2>

  <p>
    Oh, you read that book. Good for you, you literate little shit. You learned
    about meaningful names and small functions and single responsibility. You
    felt enlightened. You felt superior. You decided comments were a "code smell"
    and deleted every single one like you were doing the world a favor.
  </p>

  <p>
    Here's what that book didn't tell you: naming things is fucking hard, and
    you're not as good at it as you think. You named your function
    <code>processData()</code> and thought "yeah, that's clear." Clear to who,
    asshole? Process WHAT data? HOW? WHY? For what cosmic fucking purpose does
    this function exist? Your method is called <code>handleClick()</code> and
    it's 200 lines long. Handling what? A click? Or the entire goddamn
    application state, three API calls, and some unholy side effects you'll
    discover in production?
  </p>

  <p>
    "But if I need a comment, my code isn't clean enough!" Bullshit. That's not
    wisdom, that's an excuse. That's you being too lazy to type 15 extra words,
    dressed up as engineering philosophy. Clean code tells you WHAT. Comments
    tell you WHY. And WHY is the only thing that matters when you're debugging
    at 2 AM and you can't remember why the fuck you wrote this conditional that
    seems to violate all laws of logic and decency.
  </p>

  <h2>The Archaeological Disaster You're Creating</h2>

  <p>
    Here's how your uncommented code ages:
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Day 1:</strong> "This is elegant and self-explanatory."<br>
    <strong>Week 2:</strong> "I remember most of what this does."<br>
    <strong>Month 3:</strong> "There was a reason for this, I think."<br>
    <strong>Month 6:</strong> "What fucking psychopath wrote this?"<br>
    <strong>Year 1:</strong> "Do NOT touch this file. Nobody knows what it does.
    It works. We don't know why. If it breaks, we're fucked."
  </p>

  <p>
    That file? That sacred, untouchable file that everyone's afraid of? The one
    with the <code>// Here be dragons</code> warning that someone desperately
    scribbled as a last resort? That's YOUR code. That's the masterpiece you
    were so proud of. That's your "self-documenting" legacy, now rotting in
    the codebase like a corpse nobody wants to identify.
  </p>

  <p>
    Every uncommented function is a time bomb. Every mysterious conditional is
    a landmine. Every cryptic algorithm is a trap waiting for the next poor
    bastard who has to maintain your shit. And guess what? That poor bastard
    might be YOU. Congratulations, you played yourself.

  <h2>Exhibit A: How One Missing Comment Ruins Everything</h2>

  <p>
    Look at this innocent little snippet:
  </p>

  <pre><code>if (user.age >= 13) {
  allowAccess();
}</code></pre>

  <p>
    Seems obvious, right? Users 13 or older get access. Simple. Clean. "Self-documenting."
  </p>

  <p>
    Now it's six months later. A new regulation drops. Legal says you need to
    update the age check. The new dev looks at this line and thinks: "Why 13?
    Is this some random legacy thing? Is it a legal requirement? Which law?
    Which country? Does this apply to EU users? What about California? Can I
    change this to 16? Will something explode if I do? Is there a test for this?
    Why isn't there a test for this? WHO THE FUCK WROTE THIS?"
  </p>

  <p>
    Three hours of archaeology later, they find a Slack message from 2019
    mentioning COPPA. Three more hours reading legal documents. Two meetings
    with compliance. One existential crisis.
  </p>

  <p>
    Or you could have written:
  </p>

  <pre><code>// COPPA compliance: users under 13 require parental consent
// See: legal/coppa-requirements.md
if (user.age >= 13) {
  allowAccess();
}</code></pre>

  <p>
    Fifteen seconds to write. Twelve hours saved. But no, your precious code
    was "self-documenting." Tell that to the junior dev who's now mass-applying
    to other companies because of your arrogance.

  <h2>A Love Letter From Future You</h2>

  <p>
    Picture this: It's 2:47 AM. Production is on fire. The pager won't stop
    screaming. Your boss is texting. Customers are tweeting. The CEO just joined
    the incident channel and is "just watching." Your palms are sweating. You
    trace the bug to a function. YOUR function. The one you wrote eight months
    ago when you were so fucking clever.
  </p>

  <p>
    You stare at the screen:
  </p>

  <pre><code>const result = items
  .filter(x => x.status !== 4 && !(x.flags & 0x20))
  .reduce((a, b) => merge(a, b, true), {});</code></pre>

  <p>
    Status 4. What the fuck is status 4? The flags bitfield. 0x20. What does
    that represent? The third parameter to <code>merge()</code>. Why true?
    What happens if it's false? You wrote this. YOU. And you have no fucking
    idea what it does.
  </p>

  <p>
    Future you is sitting there, bloodshot eyes, fourth coffee, career
    potentially ending, and they're not thinking about your elegant
    architecture or your clever abstractions. They're thinking: "I wish that
    stupid asshole had written ONE FUCKING COMMENT explaining why we filter
    out status 4." They're thinking: "I am going to build a time machine just
    to punch past me in the face."
  </p>

  <p>
    That stupid asshole is you. That face is yours. The punch is deserved.
  </p>

  <h2>Comments Explain WHY, Not WHAT</h2>

  <p>
    "But comments get outdated!" Yeah, and so does your code. So do your tests.
    So does your documentation. So does everything, you maintenance-avoiding
    coward. That's not an argument against comments. That's an argument against
    being a lazy piece of shit.
  </p>

  <p>
    "But I have to maintain comments too!" You have to maintain everything.
    That's literally your job. You're a software engineer. Engineering involves
    maintenance. If you can't handle updating a one-line comment when you change
    the code it describes, maybe you should be doing something else. Maybe
    underwater basket weaving. I hear that doesn't require documentation.
  </p>

  <p>
    The comments that matter aren't the ones that say <code>// increment i</code>.
    Nobody needs that. Don't be that idiot. The comments that matter are the ones
    that explain:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Why you chose this approach over the obvious one</li>
    <li>What business rule or legal requirement this implements</li>
    <li>What weird edge case this handles and why</li>
    <li>What will break if someone changes this without understanding the context</li>
    <li>What you tried that didn't work, so the next person doesn't repeat your mistakes</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The WHAT is in your code. The WHY dies with your memory unless you write it
    down. And your memory, like your confidence in your code quality, is way
    more unreliable than you think.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Stop Lying to Yourself</h2>

  <p>
    You know what not writing comments really is? It's not a technical decision.
    It's not a style choice. It's not following "best practices." It's laziness.
    Pure, uncut, weapons-grade laziness disguised as sophistication.
  </p>

  <p>
    You're not avoiding comments because your code is so beautiful it speaks
    for itself. You're avoiding them because writing comments means admitting
    your code needs explanation. It means acknowledging that you're writing
    for humans, not just for compilers. It means giving a shit about the person
    who comes after you—which might be you, which definitely will be someone,
    and who definitely deserves better than your cryptographic puzzle box of
    a codebase.
  </p>

  <p>
    Every senior engineer who's actually senior—not just someone who survived
    long enough to get the title—knows this. They've been the person staring
    at uncommented code at 3 AM. They've cursed past developers. They've been
    cursed by future ones. They write comments now because they've learned the
    hard way that cleverness fades but confusion is eternal.
