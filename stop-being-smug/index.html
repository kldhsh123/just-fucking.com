<h1>Just Fucking Listen</h1>

<section>
  <h2>The Opening Punch</h2>

  <p>
    Someone starts talking. Before they finish their first sentence,
    you've already decided they're wrong. You're not listening. You're
    waiting for them to stop making noise so you can explain why you're
    right.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>You're not that smart. And everyone knows it except you.</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    That smug little smile when someone suggests an approach different
    from yours. That eye roll you think nobody notices. That condescending
    "Well, actually..." you can't stop yourself from saying.
  </p>

  <p>
    You're not the smartest person in the room. You're the most annoying.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>The Lie You Tell Yourself</h2>

  <p>
    "I'm just confident in my expertise."
  </p>

  <p>
    No. Confidence is being secure enough to consider you might be wrong.
    What you have is insecurity dressed up as arrogance. You dismiss
    others because deep down you're terrified of being proven wrong.
  </p>

  <p>
    "But I've been doing this for years!"
  </p>

  <p>
    So has the person you just interrupted. And maybe they learned
    something in those years that you didn't. Maybe the junior developer
    asking "stupid questions" just spotted the flaw in your architecture
    that will cost the company millions.
  </p>

  <p>
    Experience isn't an excuse to stop listening. It's supposed to be
    a reason to listen better.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>The Reality Check</h2>

  <p>
    Here's what your smugness actually costs:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      People stop bringing you ideas. Why bother when you'll just
      dismiss them?
    </li>
    <li>
      You miss critical information because you were too busy being
      right to hear it
    </li>
    <li>
      Your team stops trying to improve because innovation gets shot
      down
    </li>
    <li>
      You create an environment where only your ideas survive, and
      your ideas have the same blind spots as you
    </li>
    <li>
      Good people leave because nobody wants to work with someone who
      treats them like they're stupid
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Your "high standards" aren't elevating the team. They're suffocating it.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>The Example That Hurts</h2>

  <p>
    A junior developer suggests using a new library. Before they finish
    explaining, you say:
  </p>

  <p>
    "Yeah, I looked at that two years ago. It's not mature enough. We'll
    stick with what we have."
  </p>

  <p>
    What you missed: The library has had 50 releases since then. It's
    now used by Netflix and Google. It solves exactly the problem your
    team has been struggling with for months. But you'll never know
    because you didn't let them finish a sentence.
  </p>

  <p>
    A week later, a competitor ships a feature you can't match because
    they adopted that library. But sure, you were right two years ago.
    Congratulations.
  </p>

  <h2>The Future You're Creating</h2>

  <p>
    Smug people don't grow. They can't. Growth requires admitting you
    don't know everything, and that's the one thing your ego won't allow.
  </p>

  <p>
    In five years, you'll still be defending the same opinions while
    the world moves on. You'll blame everyone else for not understanding
    your genius. You'll never notice that the people who passed you by
    were the ones who knew how to listen.
  </p>

  <p>
    The smartest people in any room? They're asking questions. They're
    genuinely curious. They assume others might know something they don't.
  </p>

  <p>
    You're doing the opposite.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>The Closing Hammer</h2>

  <p>
    Next time someone speaks:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Let them finish. All the way. Without interrupting.</li>
    <li>Ask a question before stating your opinion</li>
    <li>Consider that they might have information you don't</li>
    <li>Say "I hadn't thought of it that way" at least once a week</li>
    <li>Admit when you're wrong. Out loud. In public.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Being right all the time is impossible. Acting like you're right
    all the time is just being an asshole.
  </p>

  <p>
    The world has enough know-it-alls. It needs people who know how to
    learn. That requires shutting up and opening your ears.
  </p>
